# What Isaac Saw

Code produced for Gizmo, a first year module in Innovation Design Engineering. The final machine creates a soundscape by tracing needles over a 3D printed object

The code produced for the end of the module can be found in `FinalCode_01Mar.ino`

There are a number of sets of prototype code in each test folder, with `FullSystemTests` containing prototypes for the system as a whole.
